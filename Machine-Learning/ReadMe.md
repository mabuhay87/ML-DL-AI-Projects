##  About
This repository documents my continuous learning and practical development journey as I train in:
-  Machine Learning (Supervised & Unsupervised)
-
Each project includes:
- Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`)
- Well-documented Python code
- Datasets or data links
- Summaries and visualizations

#  Machine Learning Projects

Projects focused on classical Machine Learning techniques such as classification, regression, clustering, and model evaluation.
*Coming Soon*

| 1 | Customer Churn Prediction = A machine learning model that predicts which customers are likely to leave a subscription service using behavioral, 
      demographic, and usage data. The project includes data  preprocessing, XGBoost modeling, SHAP explainability, and a Power BI dashboard that highlights churn risk segments and key drivers of customer 
      attrition.

| 2 | Social Security Claim Fraud Detection = This project uses machine learning to detect potential Social Security claim fraud by analyzing behavioral, financial, 
      and documentation-related risk factors. It 
      includes an XGBoost prediction model, SHAP-based explainability, and an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes fraud probability, high-risk patterns, and 
      key indicators for faster investigation.

| 3 | Review Sentiment Solution = is an end-to-end ML.NET, ASP.NET Core, and React application that predicts whether a product review is positive or negative through an interactive web interface.

##  Current Status
 *Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and AI training in progress.*  
New projects will be added as I complete each stage of my learning roadmap.
