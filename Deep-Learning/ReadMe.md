## About
This repository documents my continuous learning and practical development journey as I train in:
- Deep Learning (Neural Networks, CNNs, LSTMs)


Each project includes:
- Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`)
- Well-documented Python code
- Datasets or data links
- Summaries and visualizations
